            <h2>"L'ÉTAT, C'EST MOI!" (THE STATE IS ME!)</h2>
            <p>The reign of Louis XIV, known as the "Sun King," is the ultimate expression of the era of absolutism. His majestic portrait, painted by Hyacinthe Rigaud, is not merely a depiction of a monarch, but a manifesto of power, style, and control. It set the tone for all of Europe for centuries to come.</p>

            <div class="ornate-text-box">
                <p>It is impossible to speak of the Sun King without mentioning his main architectural masterpiece: the Palace of Versailles. It was more than just a residence; it was a tool of governance that transformed independent aristocrats into courtiers vying for a place near the Sun. It was a golden cage for the elite.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Portrait as a Political Instrument</h3>
            <p>The painting we examine is a prime example. Majestic purple velvet, a proud gaze, shining armor, and, of course, red heels. Every element here is a symbol. The slender legs, which demonstrate grace and strength, were part of his "battle" image. It was Louis XIV who made men's clothing luxurious and filled with status-defining details.</p>

            <h2>THE ART MANAGER OF THE 19TH CENTURY</h2>
            <p>First and foremost, a topic that is particularly relevant and important in our time: **Arkhip Ivanovich Kuindzhi is a Ukrainian artist!**</p>
            <p>Secondly, his figure in art should be perceived as one of the brightest geniuses of the landscape genre, as a self-sufficient, self-valuable direction in painting... The true spirit of nature, the philosophy of nature, speaks to us through each of his works.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a talented person, as they say, is talented in everything. In our time, A. I. Kuindzhi could also be a successful **art manager, promoter, and producer**… and the history of the painting "A Moonlit Night on the Dnieper" confirms this to the highest degree.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">THE ENIGMA OF ONE PAINTING</h2>
            <p class="spotlight-quote">No one before had ever engaged the entire diverse society—aesthetes, colleagues, officials, onlookers, art connoisseurs—with such intrigue. No one before had staged such an unusual exhibition—**a monographic exhibition**. Only this one painting. The windows were draped. The light was directed at it. And it **glowed**!</p>
            
            <p>It was this unique, magical glow, filled simultaneously with the stunning silence of the Ukrainian night and such "Gogolian mysticism," that became the main enigma for the viewer. To unravel this mystery, to recognize the secret of "Kuindzhi's Moonlight," **13,000 visitors** came! An incredible number for the 19th century!</p>
            
            <h3>Gossip Multiplied:</h3>
            <ul class="gossip-list">
                <li>**Skeptics:** "It's cheating! The painting is done on glass. There is a lamp behind the canvas!"</li>
                <li>**Mystics:** "It's sorcery, magic! The painting was created with moonlight paint based on mother-of-pearl."</li>
                <li>**Scientists:** "It's scientific progress, the result of chemical experiments," (said those who knew about Kuindzhi’s friendship with Mendeleev).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In any case, no one was silent! This is the **"power of PR" multiplied by the "power of art"!** Today it is known how Kuindzhi did this. There is a whole list of progressive, innovative, experimental techniques. For instance, one of the ingredients the artist added to the paints was bitumen...</p>
